## üìñ Project Overview  

This project addresses the critical challenge of diagnosing maize diseases, specifically **Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN)** and **Maize Streak Virus (MSV)**. The proposed system leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and transparency.
